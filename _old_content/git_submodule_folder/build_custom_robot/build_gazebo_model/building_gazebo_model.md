# Building a Gazebo Model

A model in Gazebo is made of links which are connected through joints. Since this is a ROS lecture, we use URDF files to declare the model. There are other ways of doing it, which will not be covered. **It is important to notice that all distances are generally in meters and all angles in radian.**
